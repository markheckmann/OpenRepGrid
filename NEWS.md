# OpenRepGrid 0.1.17

* `clusterBoot` gains `trim` arg. Construct labels in dendrogram are no longer trimmed by default (#58).
* `biplot2d`: improved color options for elements and constructs. New args `c.label.col.left`, `c.label.col.right`.
  Args `e.label.col`, `c.label.col`, and `e.point.col` now vectorized.
* `bertin` gains the arguments `col.c.left`, `col.c.right`, `col.e` and `col.e.lines` to set the color of the construct
  poles, elements and element lines (#51).
* `names` now returns element names as alternative to `elements()`.
* subsetting columns using elements names (`boeker[, c("self", "ideal self")]`) (#48)
* `cbind` and `/` to bind elements by combining the columns of the grids (#46)

# OpenRepGrid 0.1.16

# OpenRepGrid 0.1.15

* add `LICENSE.md` file
* `rgl` installation is now optional (close #41)
* rename `ward` method to `ward.D` in `cluster` (fix #36)
