### Installing R and RStudio

-   The prerequisite for installing the `OpenRepGrid` package is that R has been installed on your computer. R can be downloaded from [here](http://cran.rstudio.com/) for Windows, MacOS or Linux.

-   **RStudio** is a program that makes it easier to handle R. You can download it from [here](http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).

For both programs please follow the installation instructions on the websites.

### Installing the OpenRepGrid package

The easiest way to install the `OpenRepGrid` package is from within RStudio. Select the tab `Packages` -\> `Install` and type in `OpenRepGrid`.

### Development version

The version of the package hosted on CRAN is a checked release. The latest development version is hosted at github. To install the latest version with the features currently under development you need to follow three steps:

1.  Make sure you have the latest version of R installed.
2.  Make sure the following packages are installed. If not install them by typing

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("colorspace", "plyr", "abind", "rgl", "psych", "XML"))
```

3.  To download and install the OpenRepGrid development version from github you can use a function from the `devtools` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("OpenRepGrid", "markheckmann") 
```
