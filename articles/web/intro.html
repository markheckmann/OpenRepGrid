<p>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenRepGrid/index.html" class="external-link">OpenRepGrid
R package</a> is a software to analyze and visualize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repertory_grid" class="external-link">repertory grid</a>
(often abbreviated <em>grid</em> or <em>repgrid</em>) data. The software
is open source and available on all major operating systems. The package
is also the workhorse on which other packages of the <a href="http://openrepgrid.org/" class="external-link">OpenRepGrid project</a>, for example, <a href="https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jors.150/" class="external-link">gridsampler</a>

</h2>
<p>The repertory grid technique (RGT) is a data collection method which
originated from <em>Personal Construct Theory (PCT)</em> <span class="citation">(Kelly, 1955)</span>. It was originally designed as an
instrument for psychotherapy to shed light on a client’s construction of
the world. Over subsequent decades, the technique has been adopted in
many other fields, including market, organizational, political,
educational and sensory research <span class="citation">(Fransella,
Bell, &amp; Bannister, 2004)</span>. The data the RGT generates is
<em>qualitative</em> and <em>quantitative</em>. On the qualitative side,
the technique elicits the repertory of bipolar attributes
(e.g. <em>smart vs. dull</em>, so called <em>constructs</em> in PCT
terminology) an individual uses to make distinctions between entities of
the world (e.g. different people, so called <em>elements</em> in PCT
terminolgy). On the quatitative side, it requires rating each element on
each elicited personal construct (e.g. <em>Martin</em> gets a score of 2
on the <em>quarrelsome = 1 vs. peaceful = 6</em> construct, indicating
that Martin is quite quarrelsome). The result of the data collection
procedure is a data matrix. The constructs are usually presented as
matrix rows, the elements as columns and each cell contains the
corresponding rating score. Figure 1 depicts a repertory grid data set,
with the rows (constructs) and columns (elements) being clustered by
similarity (see below for details). A thorough introduction to the
repertory grid technique is given by <span class="citation">Fransella et
al. (2004)</span>.</p>

</h2>
<p>While it is possible to work with repertory grids directly without
further processing, it is common to submit grid data to statistical or
mathematical analysis <span class="citation">(e.g. Fransella et al.,
2004)</span>. For this purpose, software packages have been developed
since the 1960s <span class="citation">(Sewell, Adams-webber, Mitterer,
&amp; Cromwell, 1992)</span>. Today, several softwares are available on
the market, e.g. Enquire Within <span class="citation">(Mayes,
2008)</span>, GridStat <span class="citation">(Bell, 2009)</span>,
GridCor <span class="citation">(Feixas &amp; Cornejo, 2002)</span>,
Idiogrid <span class="citation">(Grice, 2002)</span>, Rep 5 <span class="citation">(Gaines &amp; Shaw, 2009)</span>, GridSuite <span class="citation">(Fromm &amp; Bacher, 2006)</span>, rep:grid <span class="citation">(Rosenberger, 2015)</span>. Despite the numerous
software packages being available, several issues are common among
them:</p>
<ul>
<li>No grid software offers all methods of grid analysis that have been
devised in the literature.</li>
<li>None of the available grid programs can be extended by the user,
i.e., the user cannot add or modify features. All listed softwares are
closed source or at least not available in a public repository.</li>
<li>There is no computational framework integrated into the available
grid programs to support experimental types of analysis.</li>
<li>The output of most grid analysis programs does not easily lend
itself to subsequent computation.</li>
<li>There is no joint community effort to improve a grid program: The
development and documentation is delegated to the software providers,
while users or researcher do usually not participate in this
process.</li>
<li>A lack of community participation in the software development and
its closed source nature leads to the problem of discontinued
development once its initiators have moved on or retired.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rationale"></a>
</h2>
<p>The OpenRepGrid project was started with the idea of overcoming above
mentioned issues. It was designed as an open source project allowing
other researchers to contribute, for example, by implementing new
features. R was chosen as the programming language as it runs on all
major operating systems, gets increasingly popular among academics and
is nowadays already taught to undergrads at many universities. The open
source nature of R makes it transparent how functions (i.e. methods of
grid analysis) are implemented. Also, R and most contributed packages
are distributed under a copyleft license. This allows reseachers to use
or modify existing code for their own needs and redistribute the code
under the same license. In total, the obstancles to experimenting and
contributing are significantly lowered compared to other softwares on
the market.</p>
<p>The open source and collaborative stance of the project may bear
another important benefit in terms of scientific progress. Currently,
there appears to exist a substantial latency between publication of new
grid analysis methods and them being made available to researchers as
software features. For example, the <em>structural quadrant method</em>
(SQM), a method to assess construct system complexity, devised over 20
years ago by <span class="citation">Gallifa &amp; Botella (2000)</span>,
may serve as an example. The SQM has not been implemented in any grid
program, hindering research and discussion of the method. The
OpenRepGrid project may help to improve this situation. If researchers
decide to build their new method in R from the beginning on, adding
their method to the OpenRepGrid package will only be a small additional
step. This will facilitate the dissemination of new methods in the
research community, leading to a reduction in time-to-market for new
methodological ideas. Once the method’s code has been tested and
documented, it can immediately become part of the OpenRepGrid package
and instantly be used by all researchers using grids.</p>
<p>Another reason for the choice of R is its growing ability to easily
build graphical user interfaces (GUI) using, for example, the
<em>shiny</em> <span class="citation">(Chang, Cheng, Allaire, Xie, &amp;
McPherson, 2019)</span> and other related R packages. The PCP community
is on average not well-versed in programming. This translates into the
need for easy to operate, GUI-based software. As shiny does not require
knowledge of other web languages (i.e. CSS, HTML, JavaScript) to build a
fully operational web application, R is also a suitable choice to
fullfill this community need.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="features">Features<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#features"></a>
</h2>
<p>An up-to-date overview of all features implemented in the OpenRepGrid
package can be found on the project’s documentation site (<a href="http://docs.openrepgrid.org" class="external-link uri">http://docs.openrepgrid.org</a>.) and in the R package’s
documentation files, accessible via <a href="https://www.r-project.org/help.html" class="external-link">R Help</a>. The implemented
features include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Data handling</em>: Importing and exporting grid data from
different formats, sorting grids, several included datasets (e.g. the
<em>boeker</em> dataset, see below)</li>
<li>
<em>Analyzing constructs</em>: Descriptive statistics, correlations,
distances, PCA of construct correlations, cluster analysis, aligning
constructs</li>
<li>
<em>Analyzing elements</em>: Descriptive statistics, correlations,
distances, standardized element distances, cluster analysis</li>
<li>
<em>Visualization</em>: (Clustered) Bertin plots (i.e. heatmaps),
biplots, clustering dendrograms</li>
<li>
<em>Indexes</em>: Intensity, complexity, PVAFF, measures of
cognitive conflict, implicative dilemmas, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the remainder, three repgrid visualizations which are frequently
used in publications and two types of statistical grid analyses are
briefly outlined as feature examples. Figure 1 shows a Bertin diagram
(i.e. heatmap) of a grid administered to a schizophrenic patient
undergoing psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy <span class="citation">(Böker, 1996)</span>. The data was taken during the
last stage of therapy. The data for this example is already included in
the package. The ratings in the grid are color-coded allowing to spot
similar rating patterns. Also, the grid was submitted to hierarchical
cluster analysis, thereby reordering the constructs and elements by
similarity as indicated by the dendrograms printed alongside the
diagram. The following code creates the diagram shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows a biplot of the grid data from Figure 1. A biplot is
the generalization of a scatterplot from two to many axes, all displayed
in a single plot. It allows reading off the approximate score of each
element on each construct by projecting an element’s position in the
plot on the construct axes <span class="citation">(Greenacre, 2010;
Slater, 1977)</span>. In the biplot, it can, for example, be seen that
the “father” is the element construed most closely to the “ideal self”.
Biplots of grid data are generally useful to generate transparency of
the individual’s overall construction of the elements and their
similarity. Figure 2 is created by the following code.</p>

<strong>Figure 2.</strong> Biplot of Böker’s
dataset.</div>
</div>
<p>Figure 3 shows the dendrogram for the elements, here the result of a
hierarchical cluster analysis using Ward’s method with a Euclidean
distances measure. Using an approach suggested by <span class="citation">Heckmann &amp; Bell (2016)</span>, the dendrogram
structures are also tested for stability. Stable or significant
structures are framed in a rectangle, indicating that “childhood self”,
“self before illness”, “self with delusion”, and “self as dreamer” forms
a stable group of elements. Figure 3 is created by the following
code.</p>
<div class="float">

<strong>Figure 3.</strong> Dendrogram of
clustering results.</div>
</div>
<p>Inter-element distances are a commonly applied measure in the
statistical analysis of grid data <span class="citation">(Fransella et
al., 2004)</span>. As already shown in the biplot example above,
distances between elements indicate which elements (i.e. persons) are
construed as similar. One distance of particular intererest in
psychotherapy research is the self-ideal distance as it may provide
useful clinical indications <span class="citation">(e.g. Taylor, Usher,
Jomar, &amp; Forrester, 2020)</span>. But also in other areas, for
example, in market research element distances are frequently used in the
analysis <span class="citation">(e.g. Hauser, Jonas, &amp; Riemann,
2011)</span>. In most cases, the Euclidean distance is selected as a
distance measure. As the maximal Euclidean distances between two
elements depends on the rating scale and the number of constructs in a
grid, several approaches to standardizing inter-element distances have
been suggested. One well known approach which has come to be known as
<em>Slater distances</em>, divides the inter-element distance by its
expected value <span class="citation">(Slater, 1977)</span>. However,
<span class="citation">Hartmann (1992)</span> showed in a simulation
study that Slater distances have a skewed distribution, as well as a
mean and a standard deviation depending on the number of elicited
constructs. Hartmann suggested an improvement measure by applying a
transformation to standardize Slater distances across different grid
sizes. This development serves as another example of above mentioned
situation, as to the best of my knowledge, Hartmann distances are
currently only implemented in OpenRepGrid and no other grid software.
Hartmann distances can be calculated using the following code.</p>

<p>The last feature example concers the detection of implicative
dilemmas. Implicative dilemmas represent a form of cognitive conflict.
An implicative dilemma arises when a desired change on one construct is
associated with an undesired change on another construct. For example, a
<em>timid</em> person may wish to become more <em>socially skilled</em>
but associates being more socially skilled with several negative
characteristics (selfish, insensitive etc.). The person might, for
example, construe the implication of becoming less timid (desired) as
becoming more selfish (undesired) at the same time <span class="citation">(Winter, 1982)</span>. As a consequence, the person may
resist to the desired change if the presumed implications will threaten
the person’s identity and the predictive power of his construct system.
The investigation of the role of implicative dilemmas in different
mental disorders is an active field of research in Personal Construct
Psychology <span class="citation">(Dorough, Grice, &amp; Parker, 2007;
e.g. Feixas &amp; Saúl, 2004; Rouco, Paz, Winter, &amp; Feixas,
2019)</span>. Implicative dilemma can be detected using the
<code>indexDilemma</code> function. For the dataset above, the results
show that a desired change on the discrepant contruct <em>balanced - get
along with conflicts</em> towards the <em>get along with conflicts</em>
pole implies four undesired changes, for example, to become more
<em>indifferent</em> and less <em>peaceful</em>.</p>

<p>In order to maximize the package’s usefulness for the grid research
community, we welcome participation in the package’s further
development. Experienced R programmers are asked to make pull requests
to the <a href="https://github.com/markheckmann/OpenRepGrid" class="external-link">OpenRepGrid
github repository</a>, <a href="https://github.com/markheckmann/OpenRepGrid/issues" class="external-link">report
issues</a>, or commit code snippets by email. Non-technical oriented
researchers without programming knowledge are invited to send us feature
requests or suggestions for collaboration, for example, to jointly
develop and implement a new repgrid analysis method. The goal is to make
OpenRepGrid useful for the majority of the repgrid community which will
only be possible via research community participation.</p>
