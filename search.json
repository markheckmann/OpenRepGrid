Hence, visual representation requires dimensionality reduction usually achieved factorization data matrix called singular value decomposition (SVD). biplot representation central grid representation, rationale briefly outlined.","code":""},{"path":"https://docs.openrepgrid.org/articles/web/visualization-biplot.html","id":"biplot-functions","dir":"Articles > Web","previous_headings":"","what":"Biplot functions","title":"Biplots","text":"OpenRepGrid number functions implemented produce different types biplots. following important ones: biplotSimple biplot2d biplotPeudo3d biplot3d functions allow change lot settings. see whole list available arguments type ? followed function name.","code":""},{"path":"https://docs.openrepgrid.org/articles/web/visualization-biplot.html","id":"biplotsimple","dir":"Articles > Web","previous_headings":"Biplot functions","what":"biplotSimple","title":"Biplots","text":"biplotSimple graphically unsophisticated version biplot. draw elements constructs vectors using similar arguments biplot2d. version quick exploration used development. colors constructs set darkred make easier differentiate constructs element labels.","code":"biplotSimple(boeker, c.label.col = \"darkred\")"},{"path":"https://docs.openrepgrid.org/articles/web/visualization-biplot.html","id":"biplot2d","dir":"Articles > Web","previous_headings":"Biplot functions","what":"biplot2d","title":"Biplots","text":"Draws two-dimensional biplot sophisticated look.

By default the range is inferred by scanning            the ratings and picking the minimal and maximal values as rating            range. You can set the minimal and maximal value by hand using the `min` and            `max` arguments or by using the `setScale()` function.            Note that if the rating range is not set, it may cause several            functions to not work properly. A warning will be issued if the range is            not set explicitly when using the importing function.             The function only reads data from the latest GridStat version.            The latest version allows the separation of the left and right pole            by using on of the following symbols `/:-` (hyphen, colon and dash). Older versions may not            separate                              the left and right pole. This will cause all labels to be assigned to            the left pole only when importing. You may fix this by simply entering            one of the construct separator symbols into the GridStat file between each            left and right construct pole.             The third line of a GridStat file may contain a no labels statement (i.e. a            line containing any string of 'NOLA', 'NO L', 'NoLa', 'No L', 'Nola', 'No l',            'nola' or 'no l'). In this case only ratings are supplied, hence, default            names are assigned to elements and constructs.       Email from Richard: The gridstat file has a fixed format with a title line, number      of constructs and elements on second line. The third line can say No labels      (actually it looks at the first 4 characters which can be any of 'NOLA','NO L',      'NoLa','No L','Nola','No l','nola','no l') in which case it skips to the data and      creates dummy labels for elements and constructs, otherwise it reads the construct      labels then the element labels, then the data. Construct labels were originally      stored as one, hence it didn't matter what the separator between left and right      pole labels was, but in the latest version where constructs can be reversed, it      looks for a fixed separator - one of slash(/), dash(-), or colon(:). Some of my      old data files might not conform."},{"path":"https://docs.openrepgrid.org/reference/importGridstatInternal.html","id":"references","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"References","title":"Parser for Gridstat data files. — importGridstatInternal","text":"Bell, R.

Using this approach also allows ratings            like: \"both poles apply\", \"none of the poles apply\" and all intermediate ratings            can be chosen.

First constructs classified 'congruent' 'discrepant'. Secondly, correlation congruent discrepant construct pair assessed big enough indicate implication. Classifying construct detect implicit dilemmas construct pairs first identified 'congruent' 'discrepant'. assessment based rating differences elements 'self' 'ideal self'. construct 'congruent' construction 'self' preferred state (.e. ideal self) similar. construct discrepant construction 'self' 'ideal' dissimilar. two popular accepted methods identify congruent discrepant constructs: \"Scale Midpoint criterion\" (cf.

'priori' criteria determine whether construct congruent discrepant supplied argument, values chosen according range rating scale used. following scales defaults chosen : Defining correlations implications constructs derived rating grid directly, correlation two constructs used indicator implication. large correlation means one construct pole implies . small correlation indicates lack implication. minimum criterion correlation indicate implication set .35 (cf.
