\title{Align constructs using the ideal element to gain pole preferences.}
\usage{
alignByIdeal(x, ideal, high = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{repgrid} object}

\item{ideal}{Number of the element that is used for alignment (the ideal).}

\item{high}{Logical. Whether to align the constructs so the ideal will have high ratings on the constructs (i.e.
\code{TRUE}, default) or low ratings (\code{FALSE}). High scores will lead to the preference pole on the right side, low
scores will align the preference pole on the left side.}
}
\value{
\code{repgrid} object with aligned constructs.
}
\description{
The direction of the constructs in a grid is arbitrary and a reflection of a scale does not affect the information
contained in the grid. Nonetheless, the direction of a scale has an effect on inter-element correlations (Mackay,
1992) and on the spatial representation and clustering of the grid (Bell, 2010). Hence, it is desirable to follow a
protocol to align constructs that will render unique results. A common approach is to align constructs by pole
preference, i. e. aligning all positive and negative poles. This can e. g. be achieved using \code{\link[=swapPoles]{swapPoles()}}. If an
ideal element is present, this element can be used to identify the positive and negative pole. The function
\code{alignByIdeal} will align the constructs accordingly. Note that this approach does not always yield definite results
as sometimes ratings do not show a clear preference for one pole (Winter, Bell & Watson, 2010). If a preference
cannot be determined definitely, the construct direction remains unchanged (a warning is issued in that case).

\examples{

feixas2004 # original grid
alignByIdeal(feixas2004, 13) # aligned with preference pole on the right

raeithel # original grid
alignByIdeal(raeithel, 3, high = FALSE) # aligned with preference pole on the left
