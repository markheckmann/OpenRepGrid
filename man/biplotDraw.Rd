\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{repgrid} object.}

\item{inner.positioning}{Logical. Whether to calculate positions to minimize overplotting of
elements and construct labels (default is\code{TRUE}). Note that
the positioning may slow down the plotting.}

\item{outer.positioning}{Logical. Whether to calculate positions to minimize overplotting of
of construct labels on the outer borders (default is\code{TRUE}). Note that
the positioning may slow down the plotting.}

\item{c.labels.inside}{Logical. Whether to print construct labels next to the points.
Can be useful during inspection of the plot (default \code{FALSE}).}

\item{flipaxes}{Logical vector of length two. Whether x and y axes are reversed
(default is \code{c(F,F)}).}

\item{strokes.x}{Length of outer strokes in x direction in NDC.}

\item{strokes.y}{Length of outer strokes in y direction in NDC.}

\item{offsetting}{Do offsetting? (TODO)}

\item{offset.labels}{Offsetting parameter for labels (TODO).}

\item{offset.e}{offsetting parameter for elements (TODO).}

\item{axis.ext}{Axis extension factor (default is \code{.1}). A bigger value will
zoom out the plot.}

\item{mai}{Margins available for plotting the labels in inch
(default is \code{c(.2, 1.5, .2, 1.5)}).}

\item{rect.margins}{Vector of length two (default is \code{c(.07, .07)}). Two values
specifying the additional horizontal and vertical margin around each
label.}

\item{srt}{Angle to rotate construct label text. Only used in case \code{offsetting=FALSE}.}

\item{cex.pos}{Cex parameter used during positioning of labels if prompted. Does
usually not have to be changed by user.}

\item{xpd}{Logical (default is \code{TRUE}). Whether to extend text labels
over figure region. Usually not needed by the user.}

\item{c.lines}{Logical. Whether construct lines from the center of the biplot
to the surrounding box are drawn (default is \code{FALSE}).}

\item{col.c.lines}{The color of the construct lines from the center to the borders
of the plot (default is \code{gray(.9)}).}

\item{zoom}{Scaling factor for all vectors. Can be used to zoom
the plot in and out (default \code{1}).}

\item{...}{Not evaluated.}
}
\value{
Invisible return of dataframe used during construction of plot
(useful for developers).

\description{
When the number of elements and constructs differs to a large extent, the
absolute values of the coordinates for either constructs or elements
will be much smaller or greater. This is an inherent property of the biplot.
In the case it is not necessary to be able to read off the original
data entries from the plot, the axes for elements and constructs
can be scaled separately. The proportional projection values will
stay unaffected. the absolute will change though. For grid interpretation
the absolute values are usually oh no importance. Thus, there is an optional
argument \code{normalize} which is \code{FALSE} as a default which
rescales the axes so the longest construct and element vector will be
set to the length of \code{1}.
