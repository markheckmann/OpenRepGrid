\title{'Hartmann distance' (standardized Slater distances).}
\usage{
distanceHartmann(
  x,
  method = "simulate",
  reps = 10000,
  prob = NULL,
  progress = TRUE,
  distributions = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{repgrid} object.}

\item{method}{The method used for distance calculation, on of
\verb{"paper", "simulate", "new"}. \code{"paper"} uses the
parameters as given in Hartmann (1992) for calculation.
\code{"simulate"} (default) simulates a Slater distribution
for the calculation. In a future version the time consuming
simulation may be replaced by more accurate parameters for
Hartmann distances than used in Hartmann (1992).}

\item{reps}{Number of random grids to generate sample distribution for
Slater distances (default is \code{10000}). Note that
a lot of samples may take a while to calculate.}

\item{prob}{The probability of each rating value to occur.
If \code{NULL} (default) the distribution is uniform.
The number of values must match the length of the rating scale.}

\item{progress}{Whether to show a progress bar during simulation
(default is \code{TRUE}) (for \code{method="simulate"}).
May be useful when the distribution is estimated on the basis
of many quasis.}

\item{distributions}{Whether to additionally return the values of the simulated
distributions (Slater etc.) The default is \code{FALSE}
as it will quickly boost the object size.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing Hartmann distances. In the attributes several additional parameters can be found:
\itemize{
\item \code{arguments}: A list of several parameters including \code{mean} and \code{sd} of Slater distribution.
\item \code{quantiles}: Quantiles for Slater and Hartmann distance distribution.
\item \code{distributions}: List with values of the simulated distributions.

\description{
Calculate Hartmann distance
}
\details{
Hartmann (1992) showed in a simulation study that Slater distances (see \code{\link[=distanceSlater]{distanceSlater()}}) based on random grids,
for which Slater coined the expression quasis, have a skewed distribution, a mean and a standard deviation depending
on the number of constructs elicited. He suggested a linear transformation (z-transformation) which takes into
account the estimated (or expected) mean and the standard deviation of the derived distribution to standardize
Slater distance scores across different grid sizes. 'Hartmann distances' represent a more accurate version of
'Slater distances'. Note that Hartmann distances are multiplied by -1. Hence, negative Hartmann values represent
dissimilarity, i.e. a big Slater distance. \cr

There are two ways to use this function. Hartmann distances can either be calculated based on the reference values
(i.e. means and standard deviations of Slater distance distributions) as given by Hartmann in his paper. The second
option is to conduct an instant simulation for the supplied grid size for each calculation. The second option will
be more accurate when a big number of quasis is used in the simulation. \cr

It is also possible to return the quantiles of the sample distribution and only the element distances considered
'significant' according to the quantiles defined.

\section{Calculation}{


The 'Hartmann distance' is calculated as follows (Hartmann 1992, p. 49).  \cr
\deqn{D = -1 (\frac{D_{slater} - M_c}{sd_c})}{D = -1 (D_slater - M_c / sd_c)}
Where \eqn{D_{slater}}{D_slater} denotes the Slater distances of the grid,
\eqn{M_c}{M_c} the sample distribution's mean value and
\eqn{sd_c}{sd_c} the sample distribution's standard deviation.
